## Movie DB

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Install project

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm install`

### `npm run`
Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The app use rest api of The Movie db. For sucessulf rest call you need apikey (in app is in Apikey.js), it is best if the key is not in github, but for checking app I leave key there. 

App is slightly different then Wireframes because I wanted to try different way. Just one window with popup window for details of movie and with video.
In the window there is search bar for searching movies, tv's. If you want to go back to original set of movies just send empty search in search bar.
